# Virtual Pet Simulator

** This project is part of a March "Code Jam" I am doing.  Read more about it here: https://mikezitek.dev/blog/posts/march-code-jam **

An AI-powered virtual pet application that allows users to interact with a digital pet through guided choices.

## Features

- Pet selection and customization
- Dynamic pet states (hunger, energy, happiness)
- Interactive events generated by AI
- Visual representation of pet moods

## How to Run

There are two ways to run the application:

### Option 1: Using the run.py script (Recommended)

```bash
python run.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Option 2: Using Streamlit directly

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

## Development Notes

- The application uses Streamlit for the UI
- Pet events are generated using OpenAI's API (gpt-4o-mini model by default)
- Pet states are saved between sessions

## Project Structure

- `app/main.py` - Main application entry point with Streamlit UI
- `app/services/` - Service modules:
  - `pet_service.py` - Handles pet state management
  - `event_service.py` - Manages event generation and handling
  - `llm_service.py` - Handles OpenAI API integration
- `app/models/` - Data models and schemas
- `app/config/` - Configuration files and settings
- `app/static/` - Static assets like images
- `app/data/` - Data storage for pet state

## Note

There is an older implementation in `app/virtual-pet-old.py` which is kept for reference but is not actively used.
